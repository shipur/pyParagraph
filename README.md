# pyParagraph
Parse and analyse passages using Python script
In this challenge, we get to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. As chief linguist, we are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, we've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.

Our task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. Our script will need to do the following:

Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

Assess the passage for each of the following:

Approximate word count

Approximate sentence count

Approximate letter count (per word)

Average sentence length (in words)
